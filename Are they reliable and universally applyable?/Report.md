## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are internationally known, and the corresponding score is widely spread. But how reliable and universally applicable are they? This project investigates the reliability of SDGs by focusing on SDG 7 and Brazil as representative examples. Since 2015, when they came into action, they have become a globally acknowledged metric. Moreover, their reach goes beyond legislation and policies, as they have achieved major societal acceptance, are valued, and are widely taught. The presence of SDGs can be observed across different sectors. Given their relevance and high frequency of application, the SDGs wield strong power. Hence, they are lucrative for companies that utilize them solely for profit.

In order to recognize such greenwashing, it is crucial to know the capabilities of the SDGs. However, the issue we are illustrating exceeds the intended wrongful use. With high frequency of application and esteem also comes the risk of overestimating the capabilities of SDGs and the expressiveness of their scores. Bias may lead us to accept the SDGs as ultimate and consistently expressive without further scrutiny. Nevertheless, their importance and power demand responsibility and examination. We evaluated sophisticated, focused research to fit these demands best. Consequently, we chose one exemplary SDG to investigate.

### 1.2 Objectives
Our main objective was to build a dashboard that functions as a tool. With our project, we intended to generate a profound understanding of SDGs and their score. Aside from examining their composition, we wanted to establish a basis that would then enable us to judge how reliable and universally applicable the SDGs and their score are. Further, we wanted to understand when we can really apply them and when we should refrain from doing so. We aimed to know what the SDG score really implies and get insights on its possible limits. In detail, we sought to understand if the SDG score truly depicts the development progress of a country in its entirety. Thus, we were meant to gain knowledge of what SDG 7 consists of, on which indicators its score is computed, and whether there are important insights left out by the selected indicators.

### 1.3 Research Question
Our emerging research question was:

> "How reliable are SDG indicators in measuring sustainable development progress,  
> particularly in the context of SDG 7 and Brazil's unique energy landscape?"

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Concept of Sustainable Development
The state of the world demands a shift towards a sustainable future, which is why the World Commission on Environment and Development was tasked by the UN to compile “A global agenda for change” in the Brundtland Report published in 1987. There, sustainable development is defined as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". This encapsulates an inherent consideration of the long-term environmental impact of human activities, promoting a harmonious coexistence of human society and the natural environment.

The dimensions of sustainable development are divided into five pillars: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnerships.

### 2.2 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 to advance the agenda of sustainable development. The SDGs provide a set of 17 objectives agreed upon by 193 UN member states. They include 169 associated targets that embrace the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability.

The lens of our research is narrowed down onto SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy, which aims to ensure global access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and clean energy. Its targets to be reached by 2030 are to:

- (7.1) Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services  
- (7.2) Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix  
- (7.3) Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency  
- (7.a) Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology

### 2.3 SDG Score
It is of critical importance to determine the degree to which SDGs are achieved, not only to hold and be held accountable but also to evaluate priorities, effectiveness of policies, and comparability. For this purpose, the SDG Score is computed. It emerges from selected indicators associated with certain targets and goals. The SDG score ranges between 0 and 100, where 0 is the lowest performance and 100 implies the goal has been achieved. Moreover, “the procedure for calculating the SDG Index comprises three steps: (i) establish performance thresholds and censor extreme values from the distribution of each indicator; (ii) rescale the data to ensure comparability across indicators (normalization); (iii) aggregate the indicators within and across SDGs.”

For SDG 7, the indicators are:  
- 7.1.1 Proportion of population with access to electricity  
- 7.1.2 Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology  
- 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption  
- 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP  
- 7.a.1 International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems

It is crucial to examine these indicators with regard to the targets they are trying to capture.

### 2.4 Brazil's Energy Landscape
Brazil, the ninth-largest energy consumer in the world, has an energy mix that is more renewable than the global average due to its extensive utilization of biofuels and hydropower. However, overreliance on hydropower exposes issues of reliability, particularly under conditions of seasonal rainfall fluctuation and climate change.

Our research reframes and elucidates challenges in the context of SDG 7 to provide a rigorous assessment of standard indicators' reliability in gauging a country's sustainable development progress.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection
In the initial phase of our project, we explored multiple datasets across various categories, evaluating their potential. Our goal was to identify a dataset that was well-structured, comprehensive, and aligned with the topic of sustainability, as it is one of the most important topics of our time.

During this process, we explored the official United Nations (UN) database, where we found a particularly relevant dataset focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This dataset provided a structured and extensive overview of the global performance of SDGs, including trends and scores for all countries for which data exists. Given its richness in information and its structured format, we decided to dive deeper into this dataset, as we believed it could form a strong foundation for our analysis and create interesting insights about the overall performance of our world in striving to become more sustainable.

#### Why Did We Choose the SDG Dataset?
After evaluating various options, we selected the SDG dataset as the primary dataset for our research for several reasons:
1. **Structured Format** – The dataset was already well-organized, requiring minimal preprocessing. It provided computed scores and visual indicators, making it user-friendly.
2. **Alignment with Research Objectives** – Since our research focuses on global sustainability trends and their implications, this dataset perfectly suited our needs.
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** – The dataset not only included overall SDG scores but also individual indicator-specific performance, allowing for a deeper analysis of the foundations on which the SDGs are built.

The dataset served as the foundation for the SDG dashboard (world map) and the indicator dashboard, which we developed to visualize global SDG and indicator performance interactively.

#### Structure of the SDG Dataset
The dataset was particularly useful due to its pre-processed structure and built-in visual representation, which allowed us to work efficiently. It contained the following key components:
- **Built-in Documentation:** An introductory page explaining its structure and methodology.
- **Global Overview:** A summary of SDG performance, where countries were assigned color-coded scores (ranging from green for high performance to red for critical performance), along with trends indicating improvements or deteriorations.
- **Indicator Database:** A detailed breakdown of individual indicators used to calculate the overall SDG scores. This allowed us to drill down into the components of SDG 7 specifically.

One of the most significant advantages of this dataset was that it did not require extensive preprocessing or structuring, allowing us to focus on analysis and visualization rather than data cleaning and transformation.

#### Additional Datasets Used
While the SDG dataset formed the core of our analysis, we integrated several additional datasets to support and expand our research:
1. **Electricity Loss Data** – Provided by the World Bank, measuring the percentage of electricity lost during transmission and distribution.  
   *Source: World Bank*
2. **Income Data** – From Destatis, detailing income distribution across different sectors and demographics.  
   *Source: Destatis*
3. **Income Spent on Electricity** – Analyzing the percentage of household income allocated to electricity costs, obtained from Statista.  
   *Source: Statista*
4. **Electricity Prices Worldwide** – Comparing electricity prices in different countries, sourced from Verivox.  
   *Source: Verivox*
5. **Data Availability** – A UN report on data availability and progress tracking for SDGs worldwide.  
   *Source: UN*

These datasets were carefully selected and combined to address our research question effectively. By integrating these factors, we aimed to critically question the expressiveness of the SDG scores.

### 3.2 Data Analysis Methods
To facilitate data processing, visualization, and interactive exploration, we utilized the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation, including reading, cleaning, filtering, and aggregating datasets.
- **Plotly** – Enabled interactive visualizations such as global maps, line charts, and bar plots.
- **Streamlit** – Used to build an interactive dashboard, allowing users to explore different SDG indicators and trends.
- **OpenPyXL** – Assisted in reading structured Excel datasets related to SDG performance.
- **OS & JSON** – Managed local file storage for user responses within the dashboard environment.

During development, our codebase expanded to over 800 rows. Initially structured as a one-pager, the code evolved organically as four different team members worked on it independently. With hindsight, a more modular approach would have been ideal. The code is essentially divided into three large sections:
- The **Instruction Page**, where users select their familiarity with SDG components and indicate their perception of their reliability. We implemented a function (`save_answer`) to record responses, utilizing sliders (`st.slider`) and drop-down buttons (`st.expander`) to enhance usability.
- The **SDG Dashboard**, where a function (`generate_map`) creates a global map that highlights various performance metrics. Although displaying SDG-button performance posed challenges, we adapted by including separate buttons alongside images to show trends for each SDG and country.
- The **Indicator Dashboard**, which is the core of our analysis and visualization. Here, preselecting countries like Brazil and Germany allowed users to generate graphs supporting various aspects of our research. We managed dashboard switching using conditional statements tied to a variable (`dashboard_choice`) and incorporated different datasets accordingly.

### 3.3 Limitations
#### Limits in Our Data:
Our mission was to determine whether SDG scores are reliable and universally applicable. In exploring the structure and weight of SDGs, we encountered several limitations:
- **Incomplete Data Coverage:** Global datasets often lack full coverage for all countries and indicators, especially in developing regions where data collection is challenging.
- **Limited Economic Indicators:** Some indicators (e.g., income spent on electricity) are available only for a limited number of countries, complicating global comparisons.
- **Economic Biases:** Exchange rate fluctuations and cost-of-living differences may introduce biases when comparing income-related metrics across nations.
- **Political Influence:** Government-reported SDG data may be influenced by political agendas, potentially leading to over- or underestimation of progress.
- **Self-Reporting and Estimates:** Some indicators are self-reported or based on estimates, making them subject to reporting biases and methodological changes over time.

#### Limits in Our Methodology:
- **Simplification of Complex Issues:** While sustainability challenges are interconnected, our analysis (and the SDGs) focus on a limited number of parameters, which oversimplifies issues such as poverty, energy access, and climate change.
- **Causation vs. Correlation:** Establishing causal relationships between economic factors and SDG progress is difficult; observed patterns may be influenced by external factors.
- **Country-Level Averages:** Using averages can obscure regional inequalities. We attempted to mitigate this by splitting performances into regions (all areas, rural, urban) and incorporating various socioeconomic factors.
- **Indicator Categorization:** The color-coded SDG scoring system reduces complex indicators into broad categories (e.g., "Challenges Remain" vs. "On Track"), potentially misrepresenting marginal improvements or declines.

## 4. Findings

### 4.1 Brazil’s Performance on SDG 7
Our interactive world map dashboard highlights Brazil’s strong performance on SDG 7. The overall SDG 7 performance is computed by aggregating various indicators, providing a comprehensive view of a country’s status.

### 4.2 Role of Hydropower in Brazil
We discovered that Brazil’s best performance within SDG 7 is on Indicator 7.2.1 – renewable energy share in total energy consumption. Brazil consistently achieves a performance level of approximately 40–50% in recent years, significantly higher than Germany’s sub-20% share. This strong performance is largely due to Brazil’s high utilization of hydropower.

### 4.3 Critique: Electricity Transmission and Distribution Losses
Beyond SDG 7, our analysis revealed that Brazil loses around 16% of its electricity during transmission and distribution—substantially more than the global average. For context, Germany’s losses are approximately 4%. In northern Brazil, energy theft is alarmingly high, with reports indicating that around 50% of the electricity may be stolen [Nuno, 2025]. Although there is no proven causal relationship between transmission losses and theft, the data point toward significant systemic challenges.

### 4.4 Affordability Concerns
Our findings on transmission and distribution losses raise questions about energy affordability in Brazil. Despite high electrification rates, Brazilian households, particularly those in low-income brackets, spend a disproportionately high percentage of their income on electricity. Graphs comparing Brazil and Germany reveal that low-income groups in Brazil face significant financial burdens, suggesting that high SDG 7 scores may mask underlying affordability issues.

## 5. Discussion
On our SDG Dashboard, Brazil is marked as green for SDG 7—placing it among only a handful of nations worldwide. This designation is based on key indicators like electricity access; by 2016, Brazil had reached a 99.8% electricity access rate. However, our findings reveal significant contradictions beneath this positive façade.

SDG 7 is tracked via four primary indicators, which provide simple, globally comparable metrics for energy access, clean cooking fuels, renewable energy share, and energy efficiency. While these metrics suggest progress, they overlook critical local issues such as affordability, grid instability, and energy losses. For instance, despite nearly universal access, many Brazilian households face exorbitant energy costs, leading to non-payment, disconnections, and energy poverty. Similarly, high renewable energy shares (mainly due to hydropower) disguise issues like grid losses and theft.

These discrepancies indicate that a high SDG 7 score does not necessarily equate to truly sustainable, reliable, or affordable energy for all. Our research underscores the need for additional indicators—particularly those addressing affordability and energy loss—to provide a more comprehensive picture of energy sustainability.

## 6. Conclusion

This analysis reveals that while Brazil appears to perform well according to SDG 7 indicators, significant unaddressed challenges persist. By comparing official datasets from the World Bank and other independent sources through our dashboard, a clearer picture of Brazil’s energy landscape emerges. Although SDG indicators effectively portray national trends, a deeper dive exposes critical issues that the current metrics overlook.

To bridge these gaps and address local challenges, we propose:
- **Introducing an Affordability Indicator:** Develop an affordability index—potentially based on the Ten Percent Rule (TPR)—to account for energy poverty. This index should consider regional disparities, income levels, and fluctuating energy prices.
- **Implementing Energy Loss Tracking:** Include indicators that differentiate between technical losses (due to grid inefficiencies) and non-technical losses (energy theft and fraud). Such metrics would help ensure that high SDG 7 scores do not mask underlying inefficiencies.
- **Enhancing Grid Infrastructure:** Invest in modernizing grid infrastructure with smart meters and improved transmission systems to reduce losses and enhance reliability.
- **Policy Interventions:** Support low-income communities with financial assistance and stricter enforcement against energy theft, thereby ensuring that high electrification rates translate into affordable, reliable energy access.

By refining the current SDG7 indicators and incorporating these additional measures, policymakers can obtain a more accurate and actionable understanding of global energy challenges. Sustainable energy must be accessible, affordable, and reliable, and our measurement systems should fully reflect these realities.
