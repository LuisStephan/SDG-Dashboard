## Abstract/ Objective

Our main objective was to build a dashboard that functions as a tool. With our project, we intended to generate a profound understanding of SDGs and their score. Aside from examining their composition, we wanted to establish a basis that would then enable us to judge how reliable and universally applicable the SDGs and their score are. Further, we wanted to understand when we can really apply them and when we should refrain from doing so. We aimed to know what the SDG score really implies and get insights on its possible limits. In detail, we sought to understand if the SDG score truly depicts the development progress of a country in its entirety. Thus, we were meant to gain knowledge of what SDG 7 consists of, on which indicators its score is computed, and whether there are important insights left out by the selected indicators.
